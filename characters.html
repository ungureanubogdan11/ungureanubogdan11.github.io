                <h2>Lightning McQueen</h2>
                <img class = "imagine-o" src = "mcqueenfirst.png" alt = "mcqueen">
                <p>Lightning McQueen is the high-octane protagonist of Pixar's Cars franchise, known for his signature red paint, number 95, and iconic "Ka-chow!" catchphrase.</p>
                <h3>Role in the Movies</h3>
                <p>McQueen's character arc is central to the series.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>In Cars (2006), he begins as a flashy, arrogant rookie obsessed with winning the Piston Cup. After getting stranded in the forgotten town of Radiator Springs, he learns humility, the value of friendship, and that "life is about the journey, not the destination."</li>
                    <li>In Cars 2 (2011), he competes in the World Grand Prix, though the film's main plot shifts focus to his best friend, Mater, who gets caught in a spy adventure.</li>
                    <li>In Cars 3 (2017), McQueen faces a new generation of high-tech racers, like Jackson Storm. He must confront his own aging and legacy, ultimately transitioning from a racer to a mentor for the young trainer Cruz Ramirez.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Voice and Animation</h3>
                <p>Lightning McQueen is voiced in the feature films by actor Owen Wilson. According to reports, Pixar's John Lasseter cast Wilson after enjoying his performance in the 2000 film Shanghai Noon. In some Cars Toon shorts and video games, he is voiced by Keith Ferguson.

Animating him was a unique challenge. His design is not based on one specific car but is a hybrid of a NASCAR stock car and a more curvaceous Le Mans endurance racer to give animators more to work with. A fun animation detail is that McQueen sometimes sticks his tongue out when concentrating, a quirk borrowed directly from director John Lasseter.</p>
<h3>Fun Facts</h3>
<ul>
    <li>His Number: McQueen's number 95 wasn't the first choice. It was originally 57, for director John Lasseter's birth year. It was changed to 95 to commemorate 1995, the year Pixar's first feature film, Toy Story, was released.</li>
    <li>His Name: He is not named after actor Steve McQueen. He is named in honor of Pixar animator Glenn McQueen, who passed away in 2002.</li>
    <li>Tire Brand: His tires are a brand called "Lightyear," a clever nod to both the real-world Goodyear brand and Pixar's own Buzz Lightyear.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Key Relationships</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Doc Hudson: This is the most critical relationship in the first film. McQueen starts as a disrespectful rookie, but he eventually earns the respect of the "Fabulous Hudson Hornet." Doc becomes a father figure and mentor, teaching him that "there's more to racing than just winning." In Cars 3, Lightning's entire journey is driven by his desire to honor Doc's legacy, even seeking out Doc's own mentor, Smokey.</li>
    <li>Sally Carrera: As the town's attorney (a 2002 Porsche 911 Carrera), Sally is the one who convinces Doc to sentence McQueen to community service. She is the first to see his potential for change and shows him the beauty of Radiator Springs and the "life in the slow lane" he was missing. She is his primary love interest and supportive partner throughout the franchise.</li>
    <li>Mater: As his first and most loyal friend in Radiator Springs, Mater (a rusty tow truck) brings out McQueen's more playful side. Their friendship is central to Cars 2 and the 2022 Disney+ series Cars on the Road.</li>
</ul>
<img class = "imagine-o" src = "mcqueentongue.png" alt = "mcqueen">
                <h3>Sponsors and Legacy</h3>
                <p>McQueen's identity is tied to his sponsors. He starts with Rust-eze, a "bumper ointment" company he's initially embarrassed by. He dreams of getting the glamorous Dinoco sponsorship, which is held by the reigning champion, "The King." A key moment of his growth is at the end of Cars 1, when he is offered the Dinoco sponsorship but turns it down out of loyalty to Rust-eze, the team that "gave him his first big break."



In Cars 3, the Rust-eze brand is sold to a new, tech-savvy owner named Sterling. This sets up the film's central conflict, where Sterling wants to retire McQueen and turn him into a brand, while McQueen still believes he can race.</p>
                <h3>Design and Real-World Inspiration</h3>
                <p>Lightning McQueen is not one specific model of car; he is a unique, custom-built Piston Cup racer designed by Pixar. His design is a deliberate hybrid of several real-world vehicles to make him look both familiar and unique.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Core: His main body and silhouette are based on NASCAR Generation 4 stock cars (used from the 1990s to the mid-2000s).</li>
                    <li>Curves: His sleek, curvaceous lines are inspired by Le Mans endurance racers like the Ford GT40 and Lola T70.</li>
                    <li>Stance: His front end, wide stance, and "face" pull heavily from the Chevrolet Corvette C6.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>His fictional specs include a V8 engine with approximately 750 horsepower and a top speed of 200 mph.</p>

                    <h2>Mater</h2>
                    <p>Sir Tow Mater, known simply as Mater, is the heart and soul of Radiator Springs. He is a 1950s boom truck inspired by an International Harvester L-170, and he is famous for his extreme rust (which he's proud of), his missing hood, a single headlight, and a prominent set of buck teeth.</p>
                    <img class = "imagine-o" src = "kingmater.png" alt = "king">
                    <h3>Role in the Movies</h3>
                    <p>Mater is the definition of a loyal friend, though his naivety often gets him (and Lightning) into trouble.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Cars (2006): Mater is the first resident of Radiator Springs to befriend a resistant Lightning McQueen. He introduces McQueen to the simple joys of life, such as "tractor-tipping" (cow-tipping with tractors). His unwavering friendship is what ultimately helps McQueen learn humility. Mater also proves his worth by becoming McQueen's pit chief, shocking the professional crews with his unconventional "Git-R-Done" style.</li>
                        <li>Cars 2 (2011): Mater is promoted to the main protagonist. While accompanying McQueen to the World Grand Prix, he is mistaken for a brilliant American secret agent. He gets entangled in an international espionage plot, proving that his simple wisdom and "dents" are valuable. He is even knighted by the Queen of England, officially becoming "Sir Tow Mater."</li>
                        <li>Cars 3 (2017): Mater returns to a supporting role, serving as McQueen's steadfast emotional support from Radiator Springs. He is the one who proudly wears a "Best Friend" hat and reminds Lightning to "use the old road" for inspiration.</li>
                        <li>Cars on the Road (2022): He is the co-protagonist with Lightning on a cross-country road trip to attend his sister's wedding.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Voice and Personality</h3>
                    <p>Mater is famously voiced by comedian Daniel Lawrence Whitney, better known by his stage name, Larry the Cable Guy. Larry's iconic catchphrase, "Git-R-Done!", was written into the character and has become Mater's signature line.

Mater's personality is that of a "big-hearted simpleton." He is incredibly kind, trusting, and fiercely loyal. He is also the self-proclaimed "world's best backward driver," a skill he taught Lightning in the first film. He also stars in his own series of shorts, Mater's Tall Tales, where he recounts his unbelievable (and likely fabricated) past as a matador, a rock star, and a private eye.</p>
                    <h3>Fun Facts</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>His Design: While inspired by the International Harvester, he was also based on a specific 1956/57 Chevy tow truck that the Pixar team found abandoned in Kansas on a research trip.</li>
                        <li>Original Color: A flashback in the Cars video game and a Cars Toon short reveal that Mater was once painted baby blue before he acquired his signature patina.</li>
                        <li>The Name: The name "Mater" was suggested by a storyteller named Joe Ranft (who also voiced Red), inspired by his time at a stock car race where he heard the term "tomater" used in a southern drawl.</li>
                        <li>The Missing Hood: According to the "Art of Cars" book, Mater's hood was sold at a swap meet, but he refuses to get a new one.</li>
                        <li>His Engine: His license plate "A113" is a famous Pixar Easter egg, referencing a classroom at CalArts, but his engine noise is a rattling, sputtering sound, perfectly matching his run-down appearance.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Doc Hudson</h2>
                    <p>Doc Hudson, also known as the Fabulous Hudson Hornet, is the wise elder of Radiator Springs. He is a 1951 Hudson Hornet, a real-life car that was a dominant champion in early NASCAR. In town, he serves as both the local doctor (mechanic) and the judge.</p>
                    <h3>Role in the Movies</h3>
                    <img class = "imagine-o" src = "hudson.png" alt = "doc">
                    <p>Doc's character is the moral and emotional anchor of the Cars franchise, even after his death.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Cars (2006): Doc is introduced as a gruff, no-nonsense judge who sentences Lightning McQueen to community service for destroying the town's main road. He initially despises McQueen, seeing him as a selfish, arrogant reminder of the racing world that abandoned him. It's revealed that Doc was a legendary three-time Piston Cup champion (the "Fabulous Hudson Hornet") whose career was cut short by a terrible crash. He disappeared, ashamed, into Radiator Springs. By training Lightning, he rediscovers his own passion for the sport and becomes Lightning's mentor and crew chief, famously teaching him how to drift on dirt.</li>
                        <li>Cars 2 (2011): Following the real-life passing of his voice actor, Doc's character also passed away. The Piston Cup was renamed the "Hudson Hornet Piston Cup" in his honor, and his clinic in Radiator Springs was turned into a museum.</li>
                        <li>Cars 3 (2017): Doc plays a pivotal role through flashbacks and legacy. Lightning, now an aging veteran himself, struggles with his own career-threatening crash. His entire journey is dedicated to honoring Doc's memory. He seeks out Doc's old mentor, Smokey, and learns about Doc's life after his crash, finding the inspiration to transition from racer to mentor, just as Doc did for him.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Voice Actor</h3>
                    <p>Doc Hudson was voiced by legendary actor and real-life professional race car driver Paul Newman. Newman was a passionate racing enthusiast, which brought a deep layer of authenticity and gravitas to the role. Cars (2006) was his final feature film performance before his death in 2008.

Because Newman had recorded many extra lines and conversations during the first film's production, animators were able to use archived, unreleased recordings of his voice for Doc's flashbacks in Cars 3.</p>
                    <h3>Fun Facts</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Real-Life Legend: Doc's backstory is not fictional. The "Fabulous Hudson Hornet" was a real NASCAR vehicle that dominated the sport from 1951 to 1953, winning three championships. Doc's racing number, 51, is a direct nod to his model year.</li>
                        <li>The Crash: Doc's career-ending crash is based on the real-life wreck of NASCAR driver Herb Thomas in 1956, who was driving a Hudson Hornet.</li>
                        <li>"Turn Right to Go Left": The famous racing trick he teaches Lightning ("He's turning right to go left!") is a real racing technique used on dirt tracks called counter-steering or power sliding (drifting).</li>
                        <li>His Original Color: In flashbacks, Doc is seen in his bright blue #51 racing livery. As the town doctor, he is a "quiet" darker blue, symbolizing his attempt to hide from his past.</li>
                        <li>Paul Newman's Influence: Paul Newman's own passion for racing heavily influenced Doc's character. Director John Lasseter has said that the film's core theme about the importance of the journey, not just the destination, resonated deeply with Newman.</li>

                <h2>Sally</h2>
                <p>Sally Carrera is the intelligent and charming town attorney of Radiator Springs and the proprietor of the newly restored Cozy Cone Motel. She is a 2002 Porsche 911 Carrera (from the 996 generation), a design choice that sets her apart from the town's older, classic models.</p>
                <h3>Role in the Movies</h3>
                <img class = "imagine-o" src = "sallyimg.png" alt = "sally"> 
                <p>Sally is a pivotal character in the franchise, especially in the first film.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cars (2006): Sally is introduced as the town's passionate advocate. She's a former high-powered lawyer from Los Angeles who, after growing tired of the "fast lane," broke down near Radiator Springs and fell in love with the town and its history. She is the one who convinces Doc Hudson to sentence Lightning McQueen to community service. She and Lightning form a bond as she shows him the beauty of the "slow lane" and the forgotten history of Route 66. She is ultimately responsible for helping Lightning find his new home and a new perspective on life.</li>
                    <li>Cars 2 & Cars 3: In the sequels, Sally plays a supporting role as Lightning's loving girlfriend. She remains his anchor in Radiator Springs, offering wisdom and unwavering support as he navigates his international fame and, later, his mid-career crisis.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Voice and Design</h3>
                <p>Sally is voiced by actress and comedian Bonnie Hunt.

Her design was a milestone for Pixar as she was the first licensed vehicle the studio was allowed to use in the film. The creative team chose a Porsche 911 because its smooth, grille-less front end allowed for more expressive animation. Her color, "Sally Blue Metallic," was custom-mixed by Pixar because the real-world Porsche blues from that era were too dark for her bright personality.</p>
                <h3>Fun Facts</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The "Tattoo": Sally has a pinstripe "tattoo" just below her rear spoiler, a small hint at her rebellious past in California.</li>
                    <li>"Stickers": She has a playful nickname for Lightning McQueen: "Stickers," a reference to his car's design being covered in "fake" headlight stickers and sponsor logos, unlike her "real" pop-up headlights.</li>
                    <li>The "Sally Special": In 2022, Porsche and Pixar collaborated to create a one-of-a-kind, real-life 2022 Porsche 911 called the "Sally Special." This car, inspired by the character, was auctioned for $3.6 million, with all proceeds going to charity.</li>
